## Project Overview:
ForestQuery is on a mission to combat deforestation around the world and to raise awareness
about this topic and its impact on the environment. The data analysis team at ForestQuery has
obtained data from the World Bank that includes forest area and total land area by country and
year from 1990 to 2016, as well as a table of countries and the regions to which they belong.
The data analysis team has used SQL to bring these tables together and to query them in an
effort to find areas of concern as well as areas that present an opportunity to learn from
successes. The task was to detrmine the following:

1. The Global situation
2. The Regional Outlook
3. Country-Level Detail (Success Stories, Largest Concerns, Quartiles)
4. Finally to make reccommendations
5. SQL Queries used
